    ## Nominating a Judge

    We need judges!

    Judges are expected to be high-tech insiders including: founders, CEOs,
    CTOs, VCs, journalists, open source developers, and others.

    Judges will be asked to write 2-3 sentence reviews of 5-10 entries, judging
    just functionality (not code) along 4 dimensions: utility/fun, innovation,
    completeness and design.

    _Tip: Fill in the Twitter username first and it'll try to autocomplete the
    rest._
